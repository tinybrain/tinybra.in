The Dolby Axon Desktop Client is a social spatial voice application built on top of the Dolby Axon game engine middleware.

I handled most of the clientâ€™s design and specification, implementation of the front-end (native Win32/WTL), and backend services related to account management, social layer persistence and payment gateway integration (MySQL/C++).

I started designing the application towards the end of the "pre-flat" era, so it isn't exactly contemporary, however compared to the concepts initially provided by a very exclusive "designer", it is still a downright model of decorum and tranquility.

There's a [review at makeuseof.com][mu] which describes the user experience.

> I was surprised at the minimal styling of the Axon interface. I came into it expecting a big, bulky sort of program with lots of flare and eye candy (perhaps that was a judgment made after watching the horrendous video above), but the compact and efficient design was a pleasant surprise.

The video the reviewer cites can be seen on [the axon site][ax], as well as a number of others showing various features which shipped with the first release on the [videos page][axv].
