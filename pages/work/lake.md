I had a range of responsibilities related to product specification and development, hardware and software validation, manufacturing tests and software development. I contributed to various parts of the Dolby Lake Controller, firmware update and preset management utilities (Win32/DirectX), and firmware for Clair iO, Lake Contour/Mesa, Dolby Lake Processor (ARM/Nucleus) and Lab.gruppen PLM series (Ti C67x/LAOS).

I handled much of the work integrating Lab.gruppenâ€™s hardware with Lake firmware and controller software, including the front panel, complex impedance load sensing, fault protection and other safety features.
