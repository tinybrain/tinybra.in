5.BOOM!! was a project which delivered a haptic LFE channel courtesy of a vortex wave cannon.

This was an entry in our annual incubator style competition, and while it doesn't remotely fall under the heading of "serious" work and was barely functional in ideal conditions, it was pretty hilarious and deserves mention.

Most people are pretty familiar with the concept of a sub-woofer or "Low Frequency Effect" channel, and in particular the phenomenon whereby directionality and localisation increases with frequency, meaning low frequency channels are mostly omni-directional. Because omni-directional sources typically attenuate with the square of the distance, the energy required to produce a sound pressure level equivalent to that produced via higher frequency channels increases exponentially.
