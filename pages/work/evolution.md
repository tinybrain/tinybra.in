A Realtime system for facilitating trusted CALM act compliance in broadcast networks.

It consisted of a realtime E-AC-3 transcoder capable of updating a stream’s ‘dialnorm’ in response to ITU-R.BS.1770 or EBU R 128 compliant levelling, and a signing mechanism implemented in metadata extensions to indicate a stream’s compliance to downstream transcoders.
