I really can't stress enough how much anyone reading this should regard this project as **informational only**, and should not under **any circumstances** attempt anything remotely similar. This project describes controlling a rediculous quantity of electricity and high pressure water in close proximity.

Hypothetically, spaduino was a drop-in MCU retrofit for a hot tub controller, specifically a New Zealand made SpaQuip SP500. The original controller was 15 years old
