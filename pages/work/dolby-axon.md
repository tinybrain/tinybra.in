The Dolby Axon Desktop Client is a social spatial voice application built on top of the Dolby Axon game engine middleware.

I handled most of the clientâ€™s design and specification, implementation of the front-end (native Win32/WTL), and backend services related to account management, social layer persistence and payment gateway integration (MySQL/C++).
