    blurb: |

      A Realtime system for facilitating trusted CALM act compliance in broadcast networks.

      It consisted of a realtime E-AC-3 transcoder capable of updating a stream’s ‘dialnorm’ in response to ITU-R.BS.1770 or EBU R 128 compliant levelling, and a signing mechanism implemented in metadata extensions to indicate a stream’s compliance to downstream transcoders.

    title: Dolby Voice & Conference Phone
    sub: A research and proof of concept platform for spatial audio applied to tele-presence.
    path: /voice/
    blurb: |

      I was part of a small team tasked with building a research and proof of concept platform for determining the viability of applying spatial audio and wide-band coding techniques to enterprise voice applications.

      Some of my work included client apps for desktop (Qt) and iOS devices, and an audio IO and network synchronisation subsystem designed to enable highly deterministic global clocking between asynchronous devices in unreliable network environments.

    blurb: |

      The Dolby Axon Desktop Client is a social spatial voice application built on top of the Dolby Axon game engine middleware.

      I handled most of the client’s design and specification, implementation of the front-end (native Win32/WTL), and backend services related to account management, social layer persistence and payment gateway integration (MySQL/C++).

    title: Dolby Lake / Lab.gruppen
    sub: Flagship loudspeaker processors and equalisers used by just about everyone.
    path: /lake
    blurb: |

      I had a range of responsibilities related to product specification and development, hardware and software validation, manufacturing tests and software development. I contributed to various parts of the Dolby Lake Controller, firmware update and preset management utilities (Win32/DirectX), and firmware for Clair iO, Lake Contour/Mesa, Dolby Lake Processor (ARM/Nucleus) and Lab.gruppen PLM series (Ti C67x/LAOS).

      I handled much of the work integrating Lab.gruppen’s hardware with Lake firmware and controller software, including the front panel, complex impedance load sensing, fault protection and other safety features.

    title: SBA Vault
    sub: An enterprise system for optimising and automating the ingest, management and distribution of music videos and audio programs for retail and commercial licensing.

    path: /sba-vault
    blurb: |

      The system was designed to eliminate redundant and erroneous handling of media assets, which previously had been processed manually and managed using several disparate databases and excel spreadsheets.

      It abstracted media assets, metadata, deliverables, batch processing and manual tasks into a dependancy graph, generating prioritised schedules for users and groups which were presented via various task oriented UIs. On completion of dependant tasks, automated tasks such as media transcoding and program generation were automatically scheduled and dispatched to a render farm. The system was implemented using .NET and SQL Server via a static ORM generator, and a desktop client built with Windows Forms and DirectShow Interop for media playback and title generation previews.
