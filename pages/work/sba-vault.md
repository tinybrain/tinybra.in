The system was designed to eliminate redundant and erroneous handling of media assets, which previously had been processed manually and managed using several disparate databases and excel spreadsheets.

It abstracted media assets, metadata, deliverables, batch processing and manual tasks into a dependancy graph, generating prioritised schedules for users and groups which were presented via various task oriented UIs. On completion of dependant tasks, automated tasks such as media transcoding and program generation were automatically scheduled and dispatched to a render farm. The system was implemented using .NET and SQL Server via a static ORM generator, and a desktop client built with Windows Forms and DirectShow Interop for media playback and title generation previews.
