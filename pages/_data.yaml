  <p>Iâ€™m a software engineer and technology generalist with many years experience building high quality systems and applications... but hasn't everyone? I mean, nobody's who sucks is going to tell you, so what exactly is the point of actually saying you're great.</p>

  <p>Anyway, amongst my weaponry are such diverse elements as professional audio, video, signal processing, computer graphics, UI/UX and networking - across a very wide range of technologies and platforms, including embedded systems, desktop and mobile, enterprise and the web.</p>
