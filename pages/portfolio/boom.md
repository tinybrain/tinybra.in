This was an entry in IdeaQuest, an annual incubator program.

Someone (not me) had the daft idea of using a [vortex cannon][canon] as a subwoofer. A colleague of mine was responsible for building the driver, while I looked after the demo.

As it turned out, the cannon's characteristics didn't translate well to traditional LFE content. It actually had a very limited repertoire, pretty much only responding to a shaped impulse which was tuned for maximum effect using trial and error.

The propagation delay was also significant being about 100 times slower than usual speed of sound (340 m/s).

On the up side, it packed a small punch - literally.

After some searching, I eventually settled on the original [Avenger's Theatrical Trailer][avengers] for demo content, supplementing the original audio with a trigger track which fired the impulse from a sampler.

The trailer is chock full of stuff which the canon was perfect for, including musical and visual cues, helicopter rotors, and plenty of things going "boom" - although none quite as cool getting a shockwave in the chest from iron man's suit.

I also did a poster...
