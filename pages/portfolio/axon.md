The Dolby Axon Desktop Client was a social spatial voice application built on top of the Dolby Axon game engine middleware.

Although originally a premium subscription service and lacking a Mac client, it was eventually ported to Qt and provided free, becoming one of the most popular voice systems particularly with MMO gamers in large guilds.

Without doubt it was the best quality voice client by far. Concepts from Axon were later used in [Dolby Voice](#voice).

I handled most of the clientâ€™s design and specification, the front-end implementation, and backend services related to account management, social persistence and messaging.
