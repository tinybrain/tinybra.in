I was part of a small team tasked with building a research and proof of concept platform for determining the viabilityÂ of applying spatial audio and wide-band coding techniques to enterprise voice applications.

Some of my work included client apps for desktop (Qt) and iOS devices, and an audio IO and network synchronisation subsystem designed to enable highly deterministic global clocking between asynchronous devices in unreliable network environments.
