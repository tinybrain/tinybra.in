I’m a software engineer and technology generalist with many years experience building high quality systems and applications.

Amongst my weaponry are such diverse elements as professional audio & video, signal processing, computer graphics, UI/UX and networking - across a very wide range of technologies and platforms, including embedded systems, desktop and mobile, enterprise and the web.

Feel free to check out the vert brief version of my [resumé](/resume), some selected projects in my [portfolio](/portfolio) - almost none of which are on [GitHub](https://github.com/tinybrain/).

If you wish to contact me, might I suggest via [email](mailto:simon@tinybra.in) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinybrain)

I'm not a :ion-social-twitter: fan.
